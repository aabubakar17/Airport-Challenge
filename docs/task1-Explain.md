# Task 1 - Explanation Of The Benefits Of The Software

## Introduction

Efficient management of air traffic flow is paramount for airports to ensure smooth operations. By providing a digital representation of the airport and enabling Air Traffic Controllers to seamlessly instruct planes to land or take off based on current conditions, this software solution will help airport's manage the flow of incoming and outgoing planes from the airport in order to mitigate the chances of congestion, delays and any safety risk.

## The benefits that the software will bring to the client:

- **Reduced congestion and delays** - The software will provide information on the current capacity of the airport and the number of planes currently stationed at the airport, this can help reduce congestion of incoming and outgoing planes, which ultimately helps to reduce delays and provide a more efficient and improved passenger experience.
- **Improve Safety** - The software will be able to control the number of planes at the airport at any given time, therefore reducing the chances of overcrowding which ultimately promotes a safer operating environment.
- **Flexibility** - The software will provide the client with the ability to override the maximum capacity of the airport therefore providing the airport with more flexibility in instances where there could be emergencies or unexpected situations
- **Assisting Air Traffic Controller** - This software will allow air traffic controllers to see the current capacity of the airport and if planes will be able to land or take off from the airport and therefore help them make informed decisions on the flow of aircraft at the airport

## The risks associated with the software:

- **Capacity Overriding feature** - The maximum capacity overriding feature, if not managed carefully can lead to human errors which can cause the risk of overcrowding and congestion. Careful management and rigorous trainings is essential to prevent any errors in the usage.
- **Overreliance** - Air Traffic Controllers and Airport staff may become too reliant on the software. While the software provides efficiency, its crucial to maintain proficiency in the manual procedures to mitigate the risk of errors that could stem from an excessive dependance on automation.
- **Software Failure** - A failure in the software may cause the inability to track the current capacity of the airport and the flow of planes. Therefore its necessary in ensuring there are contingency measures and backup protocols in place to minimise any disruptions.
