# Task 1 - Explanation Of The Benefits Of The Software

## The problem that the software is solving:

This software will help Airport's manage the flow of incoming and outgoing planes from the airport in order to mitigate the chances of congestion, delays and any safety risk.

## The benefits that the software will bring to the client:

- **Reduced congestion and delays** - Having information on the current capacity of the airport and the number of planes currently stationed at the airport, can help airports from congestion of incoming and outgoing planes, which ultimately helps to reduce delays.
- **Improve Safety** - The software will be able to control the number of planes at the airport at any given time therefore reducing the chances of overcrowding and the risk of accidents.
- **Flexibility** - The software will provide the client with the ability to override the maximum capacity of the airport therefore providing the airport with more flexibility in instances where there could be emergencies or unexpected situations
- **Assisting Air Traffic Controller** - This software will allow air traffic controllers to see the current capacity of the airport and if planes will be able to land at the airport and therefore help them make informed decisions on the flow of aircraft at the airport

## The risks associated with the software:

- **Capacity Overriding feature** - The maximum capacity overriding feature, if not managed carefully can lead to human errors which can cause the risk of overcrowding and congestion.
- **Overreliance** - Air Traffic Controllers and Airport staff may become too reliant on the software and therefore make mistakes in there management tasks.
- **Software Failure** - A failure in the software may cause the inability to track the current capacity of the airport and the flow of planes.
